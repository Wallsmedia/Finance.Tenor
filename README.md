[Tenor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tenor.asp) in finance can have multiple usages, but it most commonly refers to the amount of time left for the repayment 
of a loan or until a financial contract expires. It is most commonly used for non - standardized contracts, such as foreign 
exchange and interest rate swaps, while the term "maturity" is usually used to express the same concept for government bonds and corporate bonds. 
Tenor can also refer to the payment frequency on an interest rate swap.


**The tenor can be in the following formats:**

- Xd = X day;
- Yw = Y week
- Ym = Z month
- Gy = G year
- or any combinations of above
